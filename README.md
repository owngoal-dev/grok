# grok

[Grok Build](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build) — SpaceXAI's terminal coding
agent — built for jailbroken iOS and installed as `grok`. One arm64 build,
packaged for both **roothide** and **rootless** bootstraps.

## Install

From the [OwnGoal Studio repository](https://github.com/owngoal-dev/owngoal-packages),
or grab the `.deb` for your bootstrap from
[Releases](../../releases) and `dpkg -i` it:

| bootstrap | package architecture |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| rootless  | `iphoneos-arm64`     |
| roothide  | `iphoneos-arm64e`    |

The architecture field names the **bootstrap layout**, not the CPU — both
packages carry the same arm64 binary. If you are unsure which you have, ask the
device: `dpkg --print-architecture`.

Requires iOS 15 or later and a bootstrap that provides a shell. Then run `grok`
in a terminal on device.

## What this repository is

Packaging, not a fork. There is no application source here: the build fetches
grok-build at a pinned commit, applies the patches in `patches/`, cross-compiles
for `aarch64-apple-ios`, and produces the two packages.

The Rust binary is **not** linked with RootHide's libvroot. C tools in the
bootstrap (git, bash) can keep writing `/bin/sh` on roothide because vroot
rewrites those APIs at compile time; this process talks to libSystem directly,
so it resolves RootHide through the `.jbroot` link installed beside Mach-O
files and probes the fixed `/var/jb` prefix separately for rootless. See
`AGENTS.md`.

## Build it yourself

Needs macOS with Xcode, Rust (rustup), plus `ldid` and `dpkg`
(`brew install ldid dpkg`).

```sh
make check     # scripts, config, patch set
make debs      # both packages + SHA256SUMS, into build/Packages
```

To install on an attached device over USB:

```sh
iproxy 4422:2222 &
make install
```

`make help` lists the rest.

## Upstream tracking

The daily workflow checks the official npm `latest` version every day,
maps it to the matching public source commit, replays the complete iOS patch
stack, and publishes only after both packages pass the release build. It never
downgrades a pin that is already newer than the stable npm channel.

## Credits

Grok Build is by SpaceXAI, Apache-2.0. This repository only packages it; the
iOS patches are MIT.
